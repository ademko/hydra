
Version bump:

Windows 32-bit build:
  in /build32, cmake-gui hydra.src:
    - make sure you're in the proper VC shell type (32 or 64)
    - no shared libraries
    - no libexif
    - use a typical Qt SDK install
    - use a sqlite amalgamation
  do:
    devenv hydra.sln /build release

Windows 32-bit deployment:
  in installer\windows\32:
  copy ..\..\..\build32\release\*.exe .
  verify that these files are in there:
      (see the .nsi file for the list)
  run applymanifests.bat
    make sure the applied manifest is the same as in the distroed VC lib
  you might need to run the installer on the C:
  test under XP

for 64-bit:
  same as 32-bit, but:
    - use build64
    - requires qt to be built from source, preferably git.. build the latest 4.x stable
