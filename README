Intro
=====

Hydra ia a suite of applications and libraries for non-invasive image
and file tagging.

This allows you to:

 * Tag images collections of images with any number of tags
 * Lets you do queries (searches) on directories of images based on tags.
 * Included programs:
    - hydratag, the command line interface
    - hydraweb, the static web site generator
    - hydradesktop, a Qt based desktop application

How is this different that the other hundred image taggins applications:

 * The core tagging code is in a library, permitting more applications
   based on the database. Stay tuned.
 * The tags are non-invasive...
   The tags are stored in a central database on your computer.
   They are NOT stored in the images (the image files are not touched)
   and they are NOT stored in files in each directory (those get lost).
   This means that you can move the files anywhere, and when
   Hydra, upon recognizing the file (via its signature) will
   automatically know what tags it has.

How to compile
==============

Linux
-----

  Tested with a recent version of Linux, GCC, CMake and Qt.
  You'll need the dev version of sqlite installed.

  Run CMake on the hydra.src directory.

Windows
-------

  Tested with Visual Studio 2010, CMake and Qt. You'll also need
  the the SQLite amalgomation (the single sqlite3.c) to build with the
  library.

  Run CMake on the hydra.src directory.

  Other compilers should work too.
